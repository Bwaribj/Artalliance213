                <h3>Our Aim</h3>
                <p> <ul>
                    <li>To create that one-umbrella platform for all stakeholders and participators of the visual arts sector to further synergise in order to grow this sector into an industry, thereby serving as a catalyst for growth and development of the local economy.</li>

                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>Our Goals</h3>

                All members since inception have been committing their time, as well as their financial, human and social network resources in order to be able to push this vision through. We are at the moment calling for more members, partners and supporters. We, the members, are tired of waiting for the elusive ‘other’ people to help us develop our sector. We have erroneously looked to the govt and its organisations to rise up to their responsibility. With the arrival of this artist-run group we are taking our sector into our own hands. All who have a passion for the growth of the visual arts’ sector are welcome to join us. This group is not restricted to artists alone. Registration is by sending an email to: artalliance51@gmail.com. Registration is free.<br><br>
